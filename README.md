## Project Overview

This thesis focuses on improving a computer vision-based payload estimation method for back exoskeletons through sensor fusion. The goal is to enhance real-time estimation accuracy by integrating vision with complementary sensors (e.g., EMG, force sensors) to better support industrial workers during heavy lifting.
